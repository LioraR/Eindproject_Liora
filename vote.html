<p><h1>European Parliament Elections</h1>
<h3>The next European Parliament Elections are expected to be held around 23–26 May 2019. Elections to the European Parliament have been unable to capture the public’s interest and therefore turnout remains far lower than most national elections. Many who do vote appear more concerned with sending messages of approval to national political parties than electing representatives at the EU level. Different aspects has been looked upon when we explain why the turnout remains so low. But the most basic aspect namely how much freedom people feel to vote, is overlooked. Therefore the question remains: "To what extent is there a link between political freedom and the turnout rate of the European Parliament elections"</h3><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>


<p><h1>Visualisations</h1><h3>The voter turnout of the European Parliamentary elections of 2014 is shown in the map of Europe. When another year in the drop-down menu is selected, the map will be updated accordingly. The map has multiple interactive features such as hovering over the map and seeing the voter turnout. The map is furthermore a linked view towards two line charts, a scatterplot, and a donut chart. These will all be update ones a different country is selected.</h3>
<h3>The voter turnouts of de European Parliament elections in every country is visible and when another year is selected in the drop-down menu the bar chart is updated accordingly. It is also possible to click on the button of the VAP turnout. The voting-age population (VAP) turnout is a percentage calculated by looking at the voting age population compared to the people who voted. On the contrary, the voter turnout is defined as a percentage of people who voted from the voting-eligible population. The population which has a non-citizenship is not included in the count of the voter turnout.</h3>
<h3>The donut chart is updated when a country on the map and when a year in the dropdown menu is selected. You can hover over the donut chart and then the number of invalid votes, the turnout, and the percentage of people who did not vote are shown.</h3>
<h3>The dots in the scatterplot represent all the election results per country per year. The colors represent multiple countries and more information is shown ones hovering over the dots. A scatterplot is meant to establish various kinds of correlations and according to our research question, we want to see if there is a relationship between the freedom of a country and the voter turnout. The freedom House ranges from 1 (lots of freedom) until 4 (no freedom). In Europe, there is lots of freedom, so it is difficult to establish some kind of correlations.</h3>
<h3>The line chart represents the amount of freedom over the years in one particular country and it is updated ones a country is selected in the map of Europe. The Freedom House is an independent organization that analyses the democracy and freedom around the world and the data ranges from 1 (lots of freedom) until 4 (no freedom).</h3><br><br><br><p>
